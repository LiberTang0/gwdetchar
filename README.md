GW-DetChar - A python package for gravitational-wave detector characterisation
==============================================================================

This package provides a set of python utilities for gravitational-wave detector characterisation and data quality.

Contributing
------------

This package is maintained by [@duncanmmacleod](//github.com/duncanmmacleod), but all members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration should feel free to contribute code.

All code should follow the Python Style Guide outlined in [PEP 0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/); users can use the [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) package to check their code for style issues before submitting.

The contributions procedure is the same as [outlined for GWpy](//github.com/gwpy/gwpy/wiki/contributing-to-gwpy), namely:

- fork the repo first
- create a topical branch for your development
- create a pull request for review

This may seem pedantic, but it should help keep the code standard high and prevent the package becoming a dumping ground.
